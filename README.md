# CSUMB-Digital-Signage-Display
A small web app for use in my departments digital signage display for the giant screen people see when they walk into our building.
The code runs on the Rise Vision platform and shows visitors to our building current department events, office hours for faculty
and education related news that is pulled from ed.gov news feed.
